# About

Simple automation app to control smart windows composed of curtain, up to two contact sensors for window state (open or tilted) and input for rain sensor.

This application is meant for integration in Homeassistant and will use MQTT as a single interface to interact with sensors and 
receive inputs. 

# Disclaimer

Home project only, no guarantees. In fact, very first project in Golang, thus code is ugly as hell. Due to available hardware, code is tested with Aqara contact sensor and curtain switch only.
